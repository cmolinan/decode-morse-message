# Decode a Morse code message in Ruby language

> In this project, first we created a method to decode only a char in Morse code, returning the corresponding character in uppercase (e.g. decode_char(".-") returns "A").
> This method was used to created another method to decode a word, where every character be separated by a single space (e.g. decode_word("-- -.--") returns "MY").
> Finally, using the word decode method, we created the method to decode a entire message, where every word will be separated by 3 spaces (e.g. decode("-- -.--   -. .- -- .") returns "MY NAME").

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
git clone https://github.com/cmolinan/decode-morse-message in your terminal

Then, using your IRB program, you can decode a message like this, using the decode_all method:
decode_all(".-   -... --- -..-   ..-. ..- .-.. .-..   --- ..-.   .-. ..- -... .. . ...")
Output: => "A BOX FULL OF RUBIES"
